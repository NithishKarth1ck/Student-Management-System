Student Management System
Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, REST API, SQL (MySQL), OpenAPI

Problem Statement:
Managing student data—including enrollments, courses, and performance records—manually or through outdated systems often leads to inefficiencies, data inconsistency, and lack of secure access control. This project solves that by delivering a structured, secure, and scalable platform for administrators to manage academic records efficiently.

Project Overview:
Developed a secure and scalable web application to streamline student, course, and grade management. The system is built using Spring Boot with a clean MVC architecture and three-layered codebase, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to support full CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA and relational mappings (@OneToMany, @ManyToMany).

Integrated JWT-based authentication with Spring Security to enforce role-based access control and protect sensitive endpoints.

Applied field-level validation to ensure input integrity and CORS configurations to allow secure cross-origin communication.

Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure stability across modules.

Documented all endpoints using OpenAPI (Swagger UI) to support easy API exploration and team collaboration.
