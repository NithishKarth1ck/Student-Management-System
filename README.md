Student Management System

Tech Stack:Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, REST API, SQL, OpenAPI

Built a robust web application to manage students, courses, and grades using a clean MVC architecture and three-layered codebase. Developed and secured RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, enabling full CRUD functionality and enforcing data validation and integrity through Spring Data JPA and relational mappings (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`).

* Implemented both Basic and JWT-based authentication using Spring Security to control access.
* Designed relational database schema and ensured secure communication through field-level validation and CORS handling.
* Wrote unit and integration tests to maintain application reliability and reduce regression.
* Documented all APIs using OpenAPI (Swagger UI) for improved developer collaboration and testing.
